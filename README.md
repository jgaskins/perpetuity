# Perpetuity [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jgaskins/perpetuity.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jgaskins/perpetuity)

Perpetuity is a simple Ruby object persistence layer that attempts to follow Martin Fowler's Data Mapper pattern, allowing you to use plain-old Ruby objects in your Ruby apps in order to decouple your domain logic from the database as well as speed up your tests. There is no need for your model classes to inherit from another class or even include a mix-in.

Your objects will hopefully eventually be able to be persisted into whichever database you like. Right now, only MongoDB is supported. Other persistence solutions will come later.

This gem was inspired by [a blog post by Steve Klabnik](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-12-30-active-record-considered-harmful).

## How it works

In the Data Mapper pattern, the objects you work with don't understand how to persist themselves. They interact with other objects just as in any other object-oriented application, leaving all persistence logic to mapper objects. This decouples them from the database and allows you to write your code without it in mind.

## Installation

Add the following to your Gemfile and run `bundle` to install it.

```ruby
gem 'perpetuity'
```

## Configuration

The only currently supported persistence method is MongoDB. Other schemaless solutions can probably be implemented easily.

```ruby
mongodb = Perpetuity::MongoDB.new host: 'mongodb.example.com', db: 'example_db'
Perpetuity.configure do 
  data_source mongodb
end
```

## Setting up object mappers

Object mappers are generated by the following:

```ruby
Perpetuity.generate_mapper_for MyClass do
  # individual mapper configuration goes here
end
```

The primary mapper configuration will be configuring attributes to be persisted. This is done using the `attribute` method. Calling `attribute` will add the specified attribute and its class to the mapper's attribute set. This is how the mapper knows what to store and how to store it. Here is an example of an `Article` class, its mapper and how it can be saved to the database.

Accessing mappers after they've been generated is done through the use of the subscript operator on the `Perpetuity` module. For example, if you generate a mapper for an `Article` class, you can access it by calling `Perpetuity[Article]`.

```ruby
class Article
  attr_accessor :title, :body
end

Perpetuity.generate_mapper_for Article do
  attribute :title
  attribute :body
end

article = Article.new
article.title = 'New Article'
article.body = 'This is an article.'

Perpetuity[Article].insert article
```

## Loading Objects

You can load all persisted objects of a particular class by sending `all` to the mapper object. Example:

```ruby
Perpetuity[Article].all
```

You can load specific objects by calling the `find` method with an ID param on that class's mapper class and passing in the criteria. You may also specify more general criteria using the `select` method with a block similar to `Enumerable#select`.

```ruby
article  = Perpetuity[Article].find params[:id]
users    = Perpetuity[User].select { |user| user.email == 'me@example.com' }
articles = Perpetuity[Article].select { |article| article.published_at < Time.now }
comments = Perpetuity[Comment].select { |comment| comment.article_id.in articles.map(&:id) }
```

These methods will return a Perpetuity::Retrieval object, which will lazily retrieve the objects from the database. They will wait to hit the DB when you begin iterating over the objects so you can continue chaining methods.

```ruby
article_mapper = Perpetuity[Article]
articles = article_mapper.select { |article| article.published_at < Time.now }
articles = articles.sort(:published_at).reverse
articles = articles.page(2).per_page(10) # built-in pagination

articles.each do |article| # This is when the DB gets hit
  # Display the pretty articles
end
```

Unfortunately, due to limitations in the Ruby language itself, we cannot get a true `Enumerable`-style select method. The limitation shows itself when needing to have multiple criteria for a query, as in this super-secure example:

```ruby
user = Perpetuity[User].select { |user| (user.email == params[:email]) & (user.password == params[:password]) }
```

Notice that we have to use a single `&` and surround each criterion with parentheses. If we could override `&&` and `||`, we could put more Rubyesque code in here, but until then, we have to operate within the boundaries of the operators that can be overridden.

## Associations with Other Objects

The database can natively serialize some objects. For example, MongoDB can serialize `String`, `Numeric`, `Array`, `Hash`, `Time`, `nil`, `true`, `false`, and a few others. If an object references another type of object (such as an article referencing its author, a `User` object), the association is declared just as any other attribute. No special treatment is required.

If the associated object's class has a mapper defined, it will be used by the parent object's mapper for serialization. Otherwise, the object will be `Marshal.dump`ed. If the object cannot be marshaled, the object cannot be serialized and an exception will be raised.

```ruby
class User
end

class Article
  attr_accessor :author
end

Perpetuity.generate_mapper_for User do
end

Perpetuity.generate_mapper_for Article do
  attribute :author
end
```

This allows you to write the following:

```ruby
article_mapper = Perpetuity[Article]
article = article_mapper.first
article_mapper.load_association! article, :author
user = article.author
```

All loading of associated objects is explicit so that we don't load an entire object graph unnecessarily.

## Customizing persistence

Setting the ID of a record to a custom value rather than using the DB default.

```ruby
Perpetuity.generate_mapper_for Article do
  id { title.gsub(/\W+/, '-') } # use the article's parameterized title attribute as its ID
end
```

## Indexing

Indexes are declared with the `index` method. The simplest way to create an index is just to pass the attribute to be indexed as a parameter:

```ruby
Perpetuity.generate_mapper_for Article do
  index :title
end
```

The following will generate a unique index on an `Article` class so that two articles cannot be added to the database with the same title. This eliminates the need for uniqueness validations (like ActiveRecord has) that check for existence of that value. Uniqueness validations have race conditions and don't protect you at the database level. Using unique indexes is a superior way to do this.

```ruby
Perpetuity.generate_mapper_for Article do
  index :title, unique: true
end
```

Also, MongoDB, as well as some other databases, provide the ability to specify an order for the index. For example, if you want to query your blog with articles in descending order, you can specify a descending-order index on the timestamp for increased query performance.

```ruby
Perpetuity.generate_mapper_for Article do
  index :timestamp, order: :descending
end
```

### Applying indexes

It's very important to keep in mind that specifying an index does not create it on the database immediately. If you did this, you could potentially introduce downtime every time you specify a new index and deploy your application.

In order to apply indexes to the database, you must send `reindex!` to the mapper. For example:

```ruby
class ArticleMapper < Perpetuity::Mapper
  map Article
  attribute :title
  index :title, unique: true
end

Perpetuity[Article].reindex!
```

## Contributing

Right now, this code is pretty bare and there are possibly some design decisions that need some more refinement. You can help. If you have ideas to build on this, send some love in the form of pull requests or issues or tweets or e-mails and I'll do what I can for them.
